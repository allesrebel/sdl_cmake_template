# SDL CMake Template

This is a simple template to allow others to easily start dev on a SDL application that's cross platform through cmake.

To use this simply go to this folder and run the renamer.sh file. It will prompt you for a project and do the rest.

Once a project folder is generated, you can build using the build.sh file. Cmake will generate a makefile for you to use.
